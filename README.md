# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

This is my first weekly challenge.
I improved accessibility and semantics of the given html code.
I cloned the started repository and changed git remote origin ,
then pushed to my github repository.

- Improved funtionality by making the anchor tag work.
- Improved accessibility by adding alt attributes , title and a description.
- Improved semantics by changing html tags to more meaningful ones.
